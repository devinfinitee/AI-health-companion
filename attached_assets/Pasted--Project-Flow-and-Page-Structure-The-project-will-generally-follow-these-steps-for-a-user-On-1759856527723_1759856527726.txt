The project will generally follow these steps for a user:

Onboarding/Introduction: First-time users are introduced to the companion and its core features.

Interaction (Symptom/Query): The user initiates interaction, primarily through voice or text.

Information Delivery: The AI provides personalized health education or symptom assessment.

Action/Recommendation: The AI suggests next steps, such as booking an appointment.

Appointment Booking: If an appointment is needed, the user is guided through the process.

Confirmation & Reminders: The system confirms the appointment and sets up reminders.

Ongoing Support/Dashboard: A place for users to view past interactions, upcoming appointments, and general health tips.
